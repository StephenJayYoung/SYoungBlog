                    <p>I had wanted to learn to code for a variety of reasons – you can use it to make cool things, it allows you to work from anywhere, you can use it to help people, it’s challenging, creative, relevant, and it can be very lucrative. But taking the leap into nerd-world was just so daunting. Where should I start? How long would it take me to understand all of that stuff? What if I didn’t enjoy it and the whole process was a complete waste of time? After 9 months of “doing the thing,” I’m finally at a place in my coding journey where I can actually answer those questions. This post is a recount of where I started, how I got to where I am today, and where I want to go in the future.</p>

                    <p>After doing some research and a lot of mental back and forth, in September I signed up for Portland Code School’s JavaScript Immersion class – which was 40-50 hours per week of mind-melting coding. It was incredibly difficult – mainly due to the fact that we learned SO MUCH over the course of only about 3 months. But nothing special ever happens within the comfort zone, and the end result was that I couldn’t have been happier with my decision. I had a great teacher, made some long-lasting friendships, became integrated into Portland’s tech community, learned A LOT, and got one step closer to discovering what it was that I wanted to do within the development field. </p>

                    <p>Oh, and we made some cool projects, too. Here are links to two of them if you want to check them out: <a href= "http://www.cityhacker.com">GetCityHacker.com</a> and <a href="http://www.youngcreativespace.com">YoungCreativeSpace.com</a></p>

                    <p>School wrapped up in December, and after that I was thrown back into the real world. At that point, I didn’t fully know what I wanted to do, but I did know that I wanted to get some freelance clients and engage in some design-oriented projects. My first project was a website for a track club called that Jacuzzi Boys. It was so rewarding to be able to work on something that was helping a community build momentum, and the “Jacuzzi Boys” themselves are a helluva lotta fun to work for and be around. But it was also incredibly hard. I knew how to do a lot of the necessary development from school, but I also had to teach myself a lot. My background at PCS helped a ton with this, as I had become much better at Googling (This is honestly one of the most important, and most-used, skills I have in my tool-belt), and the contacts that I made proved to be very helpful when I got stuck in certain places, such as manipulating some of the API’s, hosting the site, and fixing things when they broke. I thought the site would only take me about 3 weeks, but it ended up taking over two months (apparently that’s usually the case when it comes to development projects). All-in-all, though, my clients were happy, I felt fulfilled, and I was motivated to jump into some more projects. Check out the JBAC’s site here: <a href="http://www.thejbac.com">theJBAC.com</a></p>

                    <p>After wrapping up with the JBAC, I started to work on a website for my girlfriend’s yoga practice. The goal with this site was to make it aesthetically pleasing, enable her students to get a feel for her personality and teaching style, and to showcase her teaching schedule. I used a bootstrap template for this one, and went to town manipulating the code to make it feel as unique as possible. I thought this site would only take me about a week, but it ended up taking over a month. I broke a lot of things, got super frustrated, and redid the site a few times, but the end result was that she really liked it, I learned a lot, and I was still super motivated to work on some more projects. Check out the website for “Isabella Yoga” here: <a href="http://www.isabellayoga.com">IsabellaYoga.com</a>  </p>

                    <p>Recently, I’ve been working on a website for a company called “PettyGrove Manufacturing.” This site has been more design-oriented than the others, and has also called upon my copywriting and marketing chops. It’s not yet finished, as it still needs a few more revisions, but you can check it out here: <a href="http://www.Pettygrovemfg.com">PettyGroveManufacturing.com</a></p>

                    <p>After reflecting on some of my projects, I learned that, if I want to be as good in this field as possible, I needed to get some continued education, especially for the front-end. So I enrolled in Portland Code School’s Advanced Front-End Development class. Here, I’ll be able to touch up on my JavaScript and JQuery skills, sharpen my AJAX and design skills, learn some new things, and hang out with cool people in a motivating environment.  </p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Some Things That I've Learned Along The Way:</h3>

                    <ol><li> Going to a code school boot camp was incredibly helpful in terms of jump-starting my coding career, and I highly recommend it</li>
										<li>You’ll never understand everything in the field of programming, but you can learn enough to get a job in 3-4 months</li>
										<li>Coding every day helps keep me motivated. I currently have a <a href="http://www.github.com/stephenjayyoung">GitHub streak</a> of 250 days – mainly because I feel like if I miss a day I won’t be as motivated to keep getting better. Also, it feels good to rack up those fake internet points.</li>
										<li>Tracking my time also helps a lot. I use Harvest (link) for this</li>
										<li>Building something usually takes 3-4 times longer than I anticipate</li>
										<li>Working with other people, and having a mentor, really helps with the learning process</li>
										<li>Working on projects that serve a real need is also very motivating</li>
										</ol>

										<h3 class="section-heading">Where I Want to Go With This in The Future:</h3>

                    <ol><li> I'd like to continue my education, and continue to obtain freelance work until August</li>
										<li>Learning some more advanced front-end development, as well as some more design aesthetics, is at the fore-front of educational goals</li>
										<li>Continueing to work on projects that help people to build communities will always be goal numero uno </li>
										</ol>

                    <p>Lastly, I want to dedicate my happiness within this field to my Mom. Without her guidance and support over the years, there is no way I would be where I am right now. She passed away about a year ago, and even though she’s no longer here, I still feel her presence in everything that I do. Here’s a short video I made in her honor right after I graduated from PCS last December.</p>

										<h3 class="section-heading">TL;DR Version:</h3>

                    <p>I went to a code school bootcamp, built some fun projects: <a href="http://wwww.getcityhacker.com">GetCityHacker.com</a>, <a href="www.youngcreativespace.com">YoungCreativeSpace.com</a>,  graduated, started doing freelance work (<a href="http://www.thejbac.com">theJBAC.com</a>, <a href="www.isabellayoga.com">IsabellaYoga.com</a>, <a href="http://www.PettyGrovemfg.com">PettygroveManufacturing</a>), and then went back at PCS to learn some advanced front-end techniques. I am incredibly happy that I chose to engage in the field of programming, and am looking forward to what the future will bring. Also, to answer my proposed questions: 
                    <ol>
                     <li>Learning to program through a code school bootcamp IS a good idea.</li>
                     <li>You’ll never understand everything in the field of programming, but you can learn enough to get a job in 3-4 months.
                     </li>
                     <li>I really enjoy this stuff, and nothing that appears worth doing is a waste of time, as long as you try your best to do it right.</li> </ol> </p>
